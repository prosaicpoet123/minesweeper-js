# Minesweeper

## What is this?

I got bored the other day and fancied a new project. I realised I hadn't played minesweeper in a long time and unfortunately it doesn't come with the newer versions of windows. So I had a go at creating my own. I intentionally limited myself to HTML, CSS and vanilla JS so as to really dive into the logic and leverage the native JS APIs.

## Get Started

At the moment its just a simple HTML document with CSS and JS dependencies. So you can download these files, right click the HTML file and run in browser. I haven't quite finalised all the logic yet

## Rules

For anyone unfamiliar with the rules of Minesweeper.

## TODOs

[ ] add timer
[ ] add and track number of mines remaining
[ ] add custom difficulty options
[ ] when losing the game, only the currently selected mine should have a red background
[ ] when losing the game, any incorrect flags should be crossed out
[ ] add dark mode
